# CPU and Memory Constraints for deployment

# Use a container called stress, which we will name hog, to generate load. Verify you have a container running.
```
kubectl run hog --image vish/stress
kubectl get deployments
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hog       1         1         1            1           1m
```

# We will use the YAML output to create our own configuration file.
```
kubectl get deployment hog -o yaml > hog.yaml

```
# edit the yaml file
```
We will need to remove the status output, creationTimestamp and other settings, as we donâ€™t want to set unique

generated parameters. We will also add in memory limits found below.

vim hog.yaml
.
imagePullPolicy: Always
name: hog
resources: # Edit to remove {}
limits: # Add these 4 lines
memory: "4Gi"
requests:
memory: "2500Mi"
terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
terminationMessagePolicy: File

```

# replace deployment

```
kubectl replace -f hog.yaml
```

# lets consume memory and cpu
```
$ vim hog.yaml
resources:
limits:
cpu: "1"
memory: "4Gi"
requests:
cpu: "0.5"
memory: "500Mi"
args:
- -cpus
- "2"
- -mem-total
- "950Mi"
- -mem-alloc-size
- "100Mi"
- -mem-alloc-sleep
- "1s"

```
